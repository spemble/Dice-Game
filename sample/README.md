AngularJS example project is based (loosely) on a challenge found at codility.com:

A game for one player is played on a board consisting of N consecutive squares, numbered from 0 to N − 1. There is a number written on each square. A non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers contains the numbers written on the squares. Moreover, some squares can be marked during the game.

At the beginning of the game, there is a pebble on square number 0 and this is the only square on the board which is marked. The goal of the game is to move the pebble to square number N − 1.

During each turn we throw a six-sided die, with numbers from 1 to 6 on its faces, and consider the number K, which shows on the upper face after the die comes to rest. Then we move the pebble standing on square number I to square number I + K, providing that square number I + K exists. If square number I + K does not exist, we throw the die again until we obtain a valid move. Finally, we mark square number I + K.

After the game finishes (when the pebble is standing on square number N − 1), we calculate the result. The result of the game is the sum of the numbers written on all marked squares.
